\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal energy of the system
    \item Properties can be path-independent
    \item Final - initial
    \item Relating VdW to molecular parmamaters
    \item Surroundigs, system
    \item walls
    \item open systems, isothermal systems, adiabatic systems, 
    \item reversible process
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reversible carried out in such a manner that it's state variables can be reversed at every stage
        \item isothermal contraction or expansion of a gas
        \item adiabatic expansion or contraction
        \item heating at a fixed pressure(isobaric)
        \item heating at a fixed volume(iochoric)
    \end{itemize}
    \item adiabatic process
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no heat transfer between system and surrounding
        \item fundamental to 2nd law of thermo
    \end{itemize}
